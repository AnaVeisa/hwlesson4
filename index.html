                <p>
                    Winter shoes are characterised by their material, insulation, and grip. Look for footwear made from durable, water-resistant materials like leather or suede. Proper insulation ensures warmth, while a non-slip sole is essential for icy conditions

                    We've said it a few times now, but sandals really are the best way of allowing your feet to breathe in the hot weather and when it comes to getting glammed up, they're the perfect footwear for showing off those newly-pedicured tootsies too!
